# pislide-os
pislide-os is a Raspberry Pi operating system designed for easily displaying photos on a Raspberry Pi. It's currently in a very early state and we've _just barely_ got everything working together. It can one day be used to create digital photo frames, digital signage, or just constantly playing a gif for fun.

It has currently been tested and works well on a Pi 3.

## TODO

There is a lot of work and packaging that needs to be done before this is ready to go, but we're working on it!

- [ ] Build/provide images
- [ ] Test on a Pi 4
- [ ] Test on a Pi 0W
- [ ] Write docs on getting started
- [ ] Provide img files that can be flashed
- [ ] Figure out networking first boot
- [ ] Move the api to a different user

## Future ideas

- [ ] Built in updater
- [ ] Splash screen
